# ARIMA Analysis on Ethereum Time Series Data

This project demonstrates the application of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to analyze Ethereum cryptocurrency time series data. It includes data preprocessing, model fitting, and forecasting to understand and predict Ethereum price trends.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares Ethereum time series data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data trends and evaluates stationarity.
- **ARIMA Model**:
  - Identifies optimal ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).
  - Fits the ARIMA model to the Ethereum price data.
  - Evaluates model performance.
- **Forecasting**:
  - Generates future predictions for Ethereum prices.
  - Visualizes predicted vs. actual prices for validation.
- **Error Analysis**: Provides metrics to assess model accuracy.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following:

- **Python** (>=3.7)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `statsmodels`
  - `seaborn`

### Steps for Execution
1. **Load Data**: Import historical Ethereum price data into the notebook.
2. **Visualize Data**: Plot time series to understand trends and seasonality.
3. **Stationarity Check**: Perform tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to evaluate stationarity.
4. **Parameter Selection**: Use techniques like ACF and PACF plots to identify optimal ARIMA parameters (p, d, q).
5. **Model Training**: Fit the ARIMA model to the prepared dataset.
6. **Diagnostics**: Check residuals to ensure assumptions are met.
7. **Forecasting**: Generate future price predictions and visualize them.
8. **Evaluation**: Compare predictions with actual values to assess performance.

### Key Learnings
- Understanding how ARIMA models work and their application in time series forecasting.
- The importance of data preprocessing and stationarity in time series analysis.
- How to interpret ARIMA parameters and diagnostics for model improvement.

### Common Errors
- **Non-Stationary Data**: Ensure data is stationary before applying the ARIMA model.
- **Overfitting**: Avoid using too many parameters (p, d, q) without sufficient justification.
- **Data Scaling**: Handle scaling issues, if any, before training the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- Experiment with seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) if the data exhibits seasonality.
- Incorporate external factors (e.g., trading volume, market sentiment) to improve forecasting accuracy.
- Compare ARIMA results with other time series models like LSTM or Prophet.

### Future Work
- Extend the model to analyze other cryptocurrencies or financial assets.
- Develop a dashboard to display real-time Ethereum price forecasts.
- Automate data fetching and preprocessing for continuous analysis.
